/**
 * Defines a comparison filter (can be a math comparison or generic equals).
 * This filter implements a comparison - of some sort - between two
 * expressions. The comparison may be a math comparison or a generic equals
 * comparison.  If it is a math comparison, only math expressions are allowed;
 * if it is an equals comparison, any expression types are allowed. Note that
 * this comparison does not attempt to restrict its expressions to be
 * meaningful.  This means that it considers itself a valid filter as long as
 * the expression comparison returns a valid result.  It does no checking to
 * see whether or not the expression comparison is meaningful with regard to
 * checking feature attributes.  In other words, this is a valid filter: <b>52
 * = 92</b>, even though it will always return the same result and could be
 * simplified away.  It is up the the filter creator, therefore, to attempt to
 * simplify/make meaningful filter logic.
